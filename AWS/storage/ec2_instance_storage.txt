-> An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for our instance.

-> This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content. It can also be used to store temporary data that you replicate across a fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.

-> An instance store consists of one or more instance store volumes exposed as block devices. The size of an instance store as well as the number of devices available varies by instance type.

-> The virtual devices for instance store volumes are ephemeral[0-23]. Instance types that support one instance store volume have ephemeral0. Instance types that support two instance store volumes have ephemeral0 and ephemeral1, and so on.

| Instance store lifetime |
+-------------------------+

    -> We can specify instance store volumes for an instance only when we launch it. We can't detach an instance store volume from one instance and attach it to a different instance.

    -> The data in an instance store persists only during the lifetime of its associated instance. If an instance reboots (intentionally or unintentionally), data in the instance store persists. However, data in the instance store is lost under any of the following circumstances:

        -> The underlying disk drive fails
        -> The instance stops
        -> The instance hibernates
        -> The instance terminates

    -> Therefore, do not rely on instance store for valuable, long-term data. Instead, use more durable data storage, such as Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, or Amazon EFS.

    -> When you stop, hibernate, or terminate an instance, every block of storage in the instance store is reset. Therefore, your data cannot be accessed through the instance store of another instance.

    -> If you create an AMI from an instance, the data on its instance store volumes isn't preserved and isn't present on the instance store volumes of the instances that you launch from the AMI.
