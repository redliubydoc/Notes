-> Stands for Elastic Block Store
-> An EBS volume is a network drive which we can attach to our instances while they run
-> EBS Volumes cannot be attached to multiple EC2 instances at a time.
-> We can attach multiple EBS volumes to a single instance. The volume and instance must be in the same Availability Zone
-> We can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires frequent updates, such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application. We can also use them for throughput-intensive applications that perform continuous disk scans.
-> EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance
