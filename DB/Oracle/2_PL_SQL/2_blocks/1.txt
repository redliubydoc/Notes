** An anonymous block is not saved in the Oracle Database server, so it is just for one-time use

| Syntax |
+--------+

    [declare]
        <variables>,
        <constants>
        <cursors>,
        <user defined exceptions>
    begin
        <sql statements>
        <pl/sql statements>
    [exception]
        <action to be performed when an error occurs>
    end;

+---------------------+
| Declaration Section |
+---------------------+

    A PL/SQL block has a declaration section where you declare variables, allocate memory for cursors, and define data types

+--------------------+
| Executable Section |
+--------------------+

    -> A PL/SQL block has an executable section. An executable section starts with the keyword BEGIN and ends with the keyword END
    -> The executable section must have a least one executable statement, even if it is the NULL statement which does nothing.

+----------------------------+
| Exception-handling Section |
+----------------------------+

    A PL/SQL block has an exception-handling section that starts with the keyword EXCEPTION. The exception-handling section is where you catch and handle exceptions raised by the code in the execution section

    Example 1:
        set serveroutput on;
        begin
            dbms_output.put_line ('Hello World!');
        end;
        /
    
    Example 2:
        set serveroutput on;
        declare
            v_message varchar2(255) := 'Hello World!';
        begin
            dbms_output.put_line (v_message);
        end;
        /

    Example 3:
        set serveroutput on;
        declare
            v_result number;
        begin
            v_result := 1 / 0;
        exception
            when zero_divide then
                dbms_output.put_line(SQLERRM);
        end;
        /
