* The NULL statement is a NULL keyword followed by a semicolon (;). The NULL statement does nothing except that it passes control to the next statement

    The NULL statement is useful to:
        -> Improve code readability
        -> Provide a target for a GOTO statement
        -> Create placeholders for subprograms
