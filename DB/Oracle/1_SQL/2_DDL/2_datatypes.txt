| Character Data Types |
+----------------------+

    * In Oracle empty string is treated as NULL
    * According to ANSI standard a character datatype must distinguish between NULL and empty strings

    1 -> CHAR(size):
        -> Stores the string only
        -> If string size is less than the size specified then extra white space is added
        -> Cannot store any string of size more than the specified size
        -> Databases: Oracle

    2 -> VARCHAR2(size):
        -> Stores the string + length of the string
        -> If string size is less than the size specified then no extra white space is added
        -> Cannot store any string of size more than the specified size
        -> Databases: Oracle

    3 -> VARCHAR(size): work exactly same as VARCHAR2 in Oracle

+--------------------+
| Integer Data Types |
+--------------------+

    1 -> INTEGER:
        -> Used to store whole number
        -> Oracle internally stores in INTEGER as NUMBER(38)
        -> INTEGER allows maximum 38 number of digits
        -> If we store decimal value in INTEGER column then it will be auto-rounded and stored

    2 ->  NUMBER(Precision, Scale):
        -> It's specific to only Oracle databases
        -> Precision => Total number of significant digits before and after the decimal
        -> Scale => Number of significant digits after the decimal
        -> If no scale is specified then by default the scale is 0
        -> If the number of digits after the decimal is greater than the scale then the digits after the decimal is rounded to scale
        -> If (precision - scale) < no. of digits before the decimal in the input number then ANSI
        -> If no precision and scale are specified then this can store any decimal number with 38 significant digits and the number is stored without any change
        -> Oracle will add trailing 0s if the number of significant digits in the input number is grater than 38

| Miscellaneous Data Types |
+--------------------------+

    1 -> DATE:
        -> Stores date only
        -> Benefits:
            -> Checks validity of dates
            -> Supports operations on date

    2 -> TIMESTAMP:
        -> Stores date + time up to one-billion of seconds

    3 -> CLOB:
        -> Stands for Character Large Objects
        -> Used to store character data greater than 4000 bytes up to 128 TB

    4 -> BLOB:
        -> Stands for Binary Large Objects
        -> Stores up to 128 TB
        -> Used to store images, videos etc
