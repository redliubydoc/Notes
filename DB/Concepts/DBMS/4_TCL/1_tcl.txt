    -> Applicable for only DML statements
    -> DDL && DCL are autocommited
    -> A Transaction will end when
        -> COMMIT / ROLLBACK is issued
        -> DDL / DCL command is issued
        -> Command editor exits or System crash
    -> Commit:
        -> Everything will be commited (Even if nothing is there)
        -> All the previous savepoints will be deleted 
        -> Any attempt to rollback to previous save point will cause an error

    -> Rollback:
        Rollback will cause an error if there is nothing to rollback
